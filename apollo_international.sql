Malaysia is a much more economical place to study for overseas students compared to other countries. QS ranked Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital, as the second most affordable student city.

An international student can work in a restaurant, a hotel, a grocery store, and various other places. Students are free to work on campus at any time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but perhaps not least, studying in Malaysia is one of the most significant possibilities for Bangladeshi students because Malaysia is a civilized economy with a top-ranked educational institute and a diverse range of disciplines. Many Malaysian universities and colleges provide a kitchenette for students living on campus to make light meals. If you don’t want to cook, KL boasts a plethora of vendors, restaurants, and food courts where you can get your daily meals for a meager price. A monthly grocery budget of around USD 100 would be highly comfortable. Malaysia also permits students to work while studying to supplement their income.</p><p><strong>Close to Home</strong></p><p>Unlike Canada, Australia, the USA or any other countries that Bangladeshi students usually go for higher studies, Malaysia is pretty close by. A flight from Kuala Lumpur to Dhaka is about four hours. This keeps the students and their parents at ease, assuring them that they are just four hours away from home and in case of any emergencies it would not be hard for them to come back. Besides, the cost of flight is comparatively lower, which sums up to roughly RM1500 (BDT 29000). This lower cost allows the students to visit their homes often, more importantly they do not have to miss out on any religious celebrations, family occasions or as such. This reason alone can be enough to let someone consider Malaysia for higher studies.</p><p><strong>High Quality, Yet Affordable Education</strong></p><p>Malaysia provides with opportunities to study from 600 plus universities around the country and all of them are in SETARA rankings. The reputation of Malaysian educational sector is rising day by day which clearly shows in the global ranking of universities. The World Economic Forum has ranked Malaysia as one of the leading countries in education. It is currently the only Asian country to make it to the top ten list of the world’s leading academic and research institution, by securing an excellent rank in the Global Ranking of Academic Reputation (GRAR). Not to mention, the tuition fee of Malaysian universities is pretty affordable too, in comparison to other counties. Students do not need to show their bank balance, hence no sponsors are required. On top of that, they are allowed to work maximum 20 hours per week. Furthermore, the conditions for admitting into Malaysian universities are not so strict. IELTS is not mandatory for all of the universities here. Also, age or study gaps are not that big of an issue. In case of credit transfer, universities in Malaysia offer that opportunity too!</p><p><strong>Living Cost is Affordable Too</strong></p><p>The living cost in Malaysia is almost the same compared to Bangladesh. According to the QS Best Student Cities rankings, Kuala Lumpur ranks number two in the world for affordability. Education Malaysia Global Service (EMGS) conducted a study once that showed an international student in Malaysia would need approximately RM1.8k (BDT 37.1k) every month including all living expenses. Of course, the amount can be more or less, depending on how much or how little you are willing to spend. Very few countries are generous enough to offer a decent lifestyle at such affordable cost. Students keep western counties on the top of their list for quality education. But, we all know how expensive living there can be. In this case, Malaysia can be a really good option.</p><p><strong>All-in-all a Good Living Environment</strong></p><p>Malaysia is a really good country to live in, especially for students. With 9% of the population being foreigners, Malaysia is kind of like a melting pot of migrants all over the world. The local people seem to be getting along with international students pretty well. As people from other countries are not seen as strangers, all the residents are treated fairly and with respect. It is no doubt that, the natural beauty of Malaysia has turned it into a lush tropical paradise. Thus, students often like to explore the country at their free time. The safe environment with political stability has made this easy for students to visit all the popular hotspots around the country. Moreover, the all-year-round weather of Malaysia is another pleasant thing! May it be summer or winter, students are prone to find the climate favorable all twelve months of the year. Not to mention, the lifestyle of Malaysia is pretty much halal in all way possible. Since, most of the students moved from Bangladesh are Muslims; it is extremely conveniently for them. Even though religious wise the country is secular, the larger number of citizens is Muslim. Hence, it has sprawling number of Mosques throughout major cities and towns. You can even easily hear ‘Adhan’ (call to prayer) from your apartment or hostel room. Besides, the wide variety of halal foods and trendy Muslim fashion are everything a Muslim student can ask for in a foreign country.</p><p><strong>Diverse Range of Options to Choose Your Field of Study</strong></p><p>Even though Bangladeshi public universities have quite a number of subjects to study, most of the private universities rely on some specific subjects that they feel will bring them profits. Then again, the number of seat in public universities is limited and every year students have to fight tooth and nail for their preferred subjects. Many students succumb to this competitiveness and fall out, shattering their dreams to study in a subject they like. Malaysia, on the other hand is providing a wide range of diversified subjects like, Hotel management, Tourism, Marine Biotechnology, Interior Architecture etc. You can even find out subjects that you have never heard about here. So, if you want to study econometrics or 3D Animation design Malaysia is the country to go!</p><p>In this era of globalization, all students want to keep a foreign degree up on their sleeve.

It is a distinct degree from traditional academic studies. In a co-op program, a student works in an area similar to the course he is taking and receives firsthand experience with his profession once he completes his degree.</p><p>For example, Lincoln University offers cooperative education or co-op at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Co-op is a paid work term that people can undertake while studying. With industry leaders like Honda or IBM, students can earn anywhere from $14 to $30 per hour.</p><p><strong>How does co-op help to boost both education and career?</strong></p><p>Students obtain a lot of knowledge about their field. A co-op program might be a great way to supplement students’ education. If they’re considering doing co-op, then they will get the following advantages:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;</li><li>As co-op students, they get compensated for their job and have the opportunity to network with employers and create valuable connections.</li><li>Students can learn more about their possible careers and see if they like them. Also, they can get away from the classroom for a while.</li><li>Students improve their interviewing and resume-building skills dramatically.</li></ul><p><strong>Eligibility for co-op studies for international students</strong></p><p>Work experience is part of the curriculum in some study programs. Besides, if students meet the following criteria, they can apply for a co-op or intern work permit:</p><ul><li>Students have to have a valid study permit.</li><li>Work is required to complete a student’s study program in Canada.</li><li>Students must have a letter from their school confirming that all students in their program must complete work placements to graduate</li><li>Students’ co-op or internship accounts for 50% or less of their study time.</li></ul><p><strong>General requirements for co-op studies&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>Before applying, students must have completed two semesters of study.</li><li>Have a GPA of 2.0 or higher.</li><li>Before students begin their applications, they have to take the one-credit co-op preparatory course (this requirement does not apply to graduate students).</li><li>If students are law students or undergraduate students, they must have the correct pattern of attendance (POA) to use careers.</li></ul><p><strong>Requirements for co-op studies for international students</strong></p><p>International students must satisfy the following conditions before beginning their co-op after accepting an offer:</p><ul><li>Attend an information session on Curricular Practical Training (CPT) for overseas students interested in co-op. CPT is a permit that allows international students to participate in co-op, internship, practicum, clinical, and corporate residency programs. Attending this class is critical because the entire process of obtaining CPT may be more challenging than you anticipated.</li><li>One of the topics discussed in the session could be that if students work for more than 12 months on CPT, they risk losing their Optional Practical Training (OPT), which allows them to work in the United States after graduation. So, if they’re thinking of attending a Co-op, they shouldn’t forget to check out the OGS event calendar to see when and how students may register.</li></ul><p><strong>Types of co-ops</strong></p><p>During studies, students can do one of the three types of co-ops listed below:</p><ol><li>6 months full-time (January to June or July to December)</li><li>4 months full-time (Summer, Fall, or Spring)</li><li>20 hours per week part-time + courses (Summer, Fall, or Spring)</li></ol><p><strong>The application process for international students</strong></p><p>The step-by-step application process for co-op studies for international students is given below:</p><ol><li><strong>Schedule a meeting with the co-op coordinator</strong>: Students have to talk to them about their career interests and aspirations; this will help them recommend Co-op possibilities that are right for that student. Through Career Counselor Appointments, students can schedule appointments with their department’s Co-op coordinator.</li><li><strong>Make a resume or a portfolio</strong>: The first thing students need for their co-op application is a strong résumé. They can and should seek resume writing assistance from their co-op advisors. They routinely interact with and speak with both companies and students to better understand what businesses are looking for and what talents or abilities students possess that they might not consider including on a resume. Student’s academic advisors can also assist them, particularly with technical jargon expressing industry-specific talents. VMock, an online resume-review tool that employs language processing and machine learning to deliver fast, individualized comments on their resume based on criteria obtained from employers and resumes from other Northeastern students, is also available for free.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Students need to create a husky account, upload a PDF version of their resume, and wait a few minutes to receive specific comments on how to improve their resume to match what employers are looking for.</p><p>Some organizations want cover letters, portfolios, or samples of students’ work, usually submitted in PDF format. If Students have a WordPress blog or their website, they shouldn’t be afraid to link to it in their resume.</p><ul><li><strong>Students can use NUcareers, Northeastern’s job, and co-op application portal, to upload their resumes and cover letter.</strong></li></ul><ol><li><strong>Using NUCareers to apply:</strong> The Cooperative Education dashboard is accessible through NUcareers’ Cooperative Education link. Students can use this page to browse for employment and events and post their CVs and cover letters. NUcareers has put together how-to articles, video tutorials, and FAQs to assist students with their co-op search. Have more concerns? Inquire with your co-op coordinator.</li></ol><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Studying a CO-OP program in Canada will open doors in the job market in ways not possible in other countries. Not only because it is a conventional disruptive training style but also because it provides teaching and the opportunity to study and experience the topic students will be focusing on.</p>', 'complete-guide-to-co-op-programs-for-international-students', 'admin/image/blog/thumbnail/blog_1658996662_353921.png', 1, '2022-07-28 18:24:23', '2022-07-28 18:24:23'),

Don’t be concerned! We recognize that staying with a foreign family is not the same as staying at home. Even if students need to adjust to the environment, homesickness, culture, and customs, there are many reasons to be excited about homestay housing. While there may be a lot to consider when selecting homestay lodging, we are here to assist students in their search for their next home.</p><p><strong>Homestay</strong></p><p>Described, a homestay is a portion of someone’s home converted into lodging for visitors for a fee. The host, generally a local family, primarily provides overnight accommodations in their home for tourists. Still, the homestay owners may also offer additional services such as meals, local travel arrangements, pickups, and more. A homestay is less daunting for first-time travelers than large, impersonal hotels. Even for frequent travelers who are constantly on the move, a homestay is a terrific opportunity to meet new people and experience a ‘home away from home atmosphere. Nowadays, many individuals prefer homestays since the hosts’ services are more personalized and cheaper.</p><p><strong>5 Reasons Why Homestays are Better</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Students are save</strong></li></ol><p>When students and parents consider studying abroad, they frequently have safety concerns. If students choose homestay as their abroad accommodation, students can rest confident that our homestay partners carefully select host families. While students explore their new surroundings and life as international students, this gives their parents peace of mind. If students are not used to living away from home, a homestay can be an excellent option because students will always have someone to look after them. Having someone to ask, “How was your day?” having dinner together as a family and spending time with your overseas friends can also help ease the transition to life abroad.</p><ol><li><strong>Students can quickly increase their language skills</strong></li></ol><p>Students will be exposed to various people, cultures, foods, and languages during your homestay. You’ll be a part of honest conversations and quickly pick up on local terminology every day. Your language and culture will be of interest to the host families. It might begin with students celebrating your country’s festivals, holidays, and special occasions while also learning about theirs! Learning about local customs and visiting tourist places with your host family can be fun to learn about their culture.</p><ol><li><strong>Students don’t miss home as much</strong></li></ol><p>Even the most self-sufficient travelers can get lonesome. Festivals, birthdays, and family dinners in your nation may be missed. Your host family can be pretty supportive during these times and may even spend time with students at a local restaurant enjoying supper to help take your mind off being homesick.</p><ol><li><strong>Students gain independence</strong></li></ol><p>Staying with a host family does not imply a lack of independence. Some students are hesitant to choose a homestay because they believe they will not have the freedom they desire or be placed with a strict host family. On the other hand, host parents understand that students want to see the city while you’re there. Because communication is crucial in everything, just let them know ahead of time if you’re going out, staying with a friend, or arriving home late. Students will not only retain a positive relationship with their host family, but students will also be able to go on their adventures during their stay abroad if students do so. In this way, homestay strikes the ideal mix between independence and having someone look after you.</p><ol><li><strong>Students will be able to save more money</strong></li></ol><p>One of the most appealing aspects of homestay is the cost. A homestay is a fantastic option because it provides much more than just a roof over your head, including safety, cultural experiences, guidance, utility services, and certain meals – all for a fair price! This means you’ll have more money to spend on excursions, activities, and weekend vacations.</p><p><strong>Benefits of Homestay</strong></p><p><strong>Meet the locals</strong></p><p>When students stay in a homestay, students get to do something students won’t get anywhere else: not only do students meet the locals, but students also get to live with them. It’s a means of experiencing a destination rather than just visiting it.</p><p><strong>Money well spent</strong></p><p>Many of our hosts provide incredible weekly and monthly savings to individuals searching for longer-term accommodations. Homestays are highly cost-effective. In Dublin, hosts offer double rooms for less than €30 per night. Others in Manhattan’s core offer rooms that start at €55 per night. Travelers to Australia’s beautiful Gold Coast may get a double hotel for as little as €34 per night.</p><p><strong>Transferring to a new city</strong></p><p>Moving to a new location is both terrifying and thrilling. When students first arrive, you’re in foreign territory, and it takes some time to adjust. Stay at a homestay, and you’ll meet some local folks right away, in their home, who will soon make students feel more at ease, secure, and at ease in your new location.</p><p><strong>Take a supper together.</strong></p><p>Our hosts are encouraged to add a complimentary light breakfast to the accommodation rate (some homestays can provide other meals too by prior arrangement). The best part is that you’ll share a dinner with your hosts and learn firsthand about the region and local culture.</p><p><strong>Ideal for single travelers</strong></p><p>While traveling the world is a fantastic experience, there’s something comfortable about staying with someone who knows the area well when students arrive. You’ll meet interesting people, share tales and experiences, and learn about the place through the eyes of the locals when students stay in a homestay. Traveling alone may be a freeing experience, and some would say that it is the ideal way to travel.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>A homestay is something students should do at least once because it allows students to see the place through the eyes of a native. You’ll fall in love with the notion of living in a homestay because of the personalized experiences it provides. Stay with family students like and choose homestays correctly for your next holiday, and you’ll never be homesick!</p>', 'why-homestay-is-the-best-accommodation-for-international-students', 'admin/image/blog/thumbnail/blog_1658997352_289254.png', 1, '2022-07-28 18:35:53', '2022-07-28 18:35:53'),

It’s a tax identification number for firms, freelancers, and contractors. Although this identification number is uncommon among international students, it is necessary to know it if someone wishes to work in their spare time. Not everyone is eligible for an ABN, but after you complete the process through the ATO’s website, it will tell you if you are. If students work for themselves and are paid by invoice, they will require this. To obtain an ABN, students must submit an application to the Australian Business Register (ABR) or through a Tax consultant. If all of the essential information is presented and the applicant is eligible for an ABN, he will receive his ABN number immediately after completing the application procedure. However, if there is missing or unconfirmed information, it may be necessary to process the material manually, which might take up to 28 days.</p><p><strong>What is TFN?</strong></p><p>TFN (Tax File Number) is a one-of-a-kind number used to identify a taxpayer. Everyone operating on behalf of an employer in Australia must have a TFN number. It allows companies to deduct tax from employees’ wages under the PAYG (Pay As You Go) system, and it also allows employees to reclaim some of that tax when filing their taxes. It’s wise to apply for it as soon as possible because the Australian government gets up to 28 days to provide the applicant with his unique TFN number. If they have a TNF number, people won’t have to worry about having a tax liability at the end of the year.</p><p><i><strong>Note: </strong>Avoid working more than 20 hours per week (apart from during university holidays). Less is better. Alternatively, students may face expulsion from the country.</i></p><p><strong>Differences between TFN and ABN.</strong></p><p>Working with a Tax File Number (TFN) implies that their employer will withhold tax from each payment and make payments to their superannuation. All individuals working in Australia must have a Tax File Number to pay their taxes on time. When someone changes jobs or starts working for a new company, they need the TFN number in the formal employment paperwork. It also covers Worker’s Compensation Insurance in case of a workplace injury.</p><p>&nbsp;On the other hand, working with an ABN means that the employer is not required to withhold tax and is not required to pay superannuation. Self-employed individuals must have an ABN number for the tax process. They must themselves deduct taxes and declare them within the timeframe specified by the Australian tax authority. And because in ABN, no tax is deducted at the point of sale, the person who issues the invoice and receives the payment is receiving full payment for the items or services. However, a portion of that revenue should be kept to cover the tax liability at the end of the fiscal year.</p><p>People with a TFN pay their taxes at the time of payment.

If they plan to drive in NSW, it is strongly advised that they additionally acquire third-party property damage or comprehensive insurance for their vehicle.</p><p><strong>Importance of road rules and laws of driving</strong></p><p>International students in Australia face some challenges when driving because they must be familiar with the country’s basic road rules. Here are some fundamental guidelines to follow:</p><ul><li>Always carry a driving license.&nbsp;</li><li>The driver, including the passengers, needs to wear safety belts in the car.</li><li>Littering and throwing anything out of the car is strictly prohibited.&nbsp;</li><li>Be cautious of speed limits and make sure to follow them.&nbsp;</li><li>Never use a mobile phone while driving.&nbsp;</li><li>Kids younger than seven years must be seated in their car seats.&nbsp;</li><li>Last but not least, don’t drink and drive.</li></ul><h4><strong>Conclution</strong></h4><p>It’s critical to understand our responsibilities for keeping our car or motorcycle roadworthy. Each state in Australia has its own set of rules, tests, and other requirements. However, their sole purpose is to determine whether or not someone can drive safely. The road rules in Australia are the most similar to those in New Zealand.

This makes the land down under, a perfect destination to study, work and live.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>In total, 43 universities are public and managed by the government. The number of students starting their Ph.D. programs is gradually rising. In Australia, Ph.D. is a journey of 4 years, while in the USA and Canada, Ph.D. requires 6 years. To study the Ph.D. program, students must interact with the supervisors for research work. The research work in Australia is globally recognized. Besides doing a Ph.D., a student can also do a part-time job to gain financial stability. However, that is often unnecessary since the university usually pays for accommodation and expenses and offers a stipend to Ph.D. students who do not have to pay the education fees. After an international student has completed their graduation, Australia provides a visa in the form of post graduation. On the other hand, only domestic students in Australia can take their research work for a half time while the international students have to take their research work on a full-time basis.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, Australia only provides one type of visa known as subclass 500, a student visa. A student who wants to study for a Ph.D. can only get a student visa. Australia also provides 485 visas to skilled graduates, however, this visa is not for a lifetime. Before applying for a student visa, a student should confirm that he or she will complete the Ph.D. After they are done with their graduation, this visa permits the international students to shift to work for a short term period; the students can also travel and study in any area. Although, there is validity of this visa depends on what degree a student has chosen. If a student has completed their Bachelor’s degree, or Master degree or Master’s dissertation degree then they can stay for two years. An international student can live in Australia for three years if they have completed research work under a Master’s degree. If an international student has completed his Ph.D. in Australia, then they can stay for four years. Although, if the validity for the 485 visa ends up, then the international students can choose to apply for permanent residency. However, international students can face difficulty finding a permanent residency.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>The immigration supremacy in Australia contemplates permanent residency based on some points. The points are based on:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Age Group</li><li>Proficient Individual</li><li>Fluency in English</li><li>Schooling Credentials&nbsp;</li><li>The course of Study in Australia</li><li>Linguistic community</li><li>Learning in Regional Australia</li><li>Inter-organizational ability</li><li>Ace in Australia</li></ul><p>However, international students will only receive permanent residency if they can prove that their skills are not matched by local Australians. International students should have work experience with an organization for skill qualification. If the international students visit Australia for two years of Bachelor’s degree, it reduces the chance for the student to get permanent residency in Australia. Also, if the student has not applied for a post-study working visa, it is again difficult to get a permanent residence in Australia. The international students doing a Master’s by research work and Doctorate are more likely to get permanent residency as they can stay in Australia for three consecutive years. There is an age limit to receive permanent residence between 25 and 30 years old. Although, the international students aged from 18 to 25 years and those aged from 33 to 39 years can also receive permanent residency. If an international student thinks that they have completed the requirements, they can take the Australian Skilled Visa Assessment. However, the system of getting permanent residency keeps changing abruptly. International students should apply for post-graduation after they have finished their graduation.</p><p>There are several reasons for applying for a student visa to do p.H.D in Australia.</p><ul><li>&nbsp;<ul><li><strong>Prominent Research Work:</strong>&nbsp;Australia is considered prominent in research work. Their research paper is well recognized internationally.</li><li><strong>Doctorate Flexibility:</strong>&nbsp;Some specific courses are offered only by the universities in Australia. Ayers Rock university offers Marine Biology, a unique course offered by the university.&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h3><br><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3><p>In conclusion, the international students in Australia should maintain the criteria as per the instructions provided to get permanent residency. However, getting a p.H.d does add points under your belt, making you a valuable candidate for Australian permanent residency.</p>', 'does-phd-make-getting-pr-in-australia-any-easieri', 'admin/image/blog/thumbnail/blog_1659004894_254184.png', 1, '2022-07-28 20:41:35', '2022-07-28 20:41:35'),

In Canada, more than 6,00,000 students are admitted to different universities of Canada. Also, Canada is a popular choice for higher studies for Bangladeshi students. Canada has a multicultural environment, so international students are encouraged to select Canada for analysis. The universities in Canada save an immense amount of public spending. Canada is considered a significant country in its high quality of life.

After the student has completed their post-graduation in Canada, they would like to receive a permanent residency in Canada.

A graduate preparation program (also known as a Pre-pathway) Master’s can assist you in preparing for and obtaining admission to a master’s degree program.</p><p>These courses provide you access to top universities in Australia and the US that you might not have been able to get into otherwise. You can start your route to a degree and career success by choosing from various degree courses and universities in fantastic Australian locations.</p><h2><strong>What is a pre-masters degree?</strong></h2><p>If you’ve been considering pursuing a postgraduate qualification, particularly a master’s degree, you’ve probably come across pre-programs master’s throughout your research. The differences between the Qualifications and courses are not always apparent or why you’d apply for or enroll in a pre-master program. We examine pre-masters courses and programs in greater depth, decoding the jargon.</p><p>Pre-Master programs offer overseas students a straight route to various university postgraduate degrees. These programs provide you with the academic tools to complete your master’s degree, such as academic writing, attentive listening skills, a basic understanding of academic terminologies, and the confidence to succeed. Pre-master courses include a variety of disciplines, study skills, and English language training tailored to fit the needs of international students. The completion time for Pre-programs masters programs is in 12 months.</p><h3>Scopes of pre-masters in Australia</h3><p>Thousands of students from all over the world apply each year to study at Australian institutions to improve their academic talents. Nonetheless, not all of them are successful in meeting the admission requirements. Some people change their minds about what they want to do with their lives, and their undergraduate courses don’t match their new passions. Others lack the English language proficiency required for advanced-level English-taught courses, while others wish they could start a master’s degree with a firmer foundation. A pre-masters system is for you if you fit into these categories.</p><p>A pre-program master’s curriculum is for international students who want a solid foundation before beginning their postgraduate studies. This type, of course, provides students with the necessary theoretical principles and practical tools for a specific subject of study. Students take classes to improve their academic writing skills, increase their language skills, and familiarize themselves with academic terminologies before beginning a complete degree.</p><p>A pre-course master’s fits the students’ demands. It could be a subject-related course or English language instruction. A program like this is usually a short-term course that lasts no longer than a year. Pre-master courses include a variety of disciplines, study skills, and English language training, all of which meet the needs of international students. Pre-programs master’s are typically completed in 12 months.</p><h3>Requirements for pre-masters in Australia</h3><p>A pre-master course is a godsend for overseas students who do not meet the entry standards of their preferred educational institutions. Yet, to enroll in a pre-program or master’s, you must complete specific conditions.</p><p>While the requirements may differ from one institution to the next, the following are some common characteristics to look for in the entrance criteria for a pre-masters course in the United Kingdom:</p><p>An internationally recognized higher-level diploma in your topic of interest<br>An undergraduate degree in your field of interest that is recognized<br>A bachelor’s degree with honors in any subject</p><p>A minimum IELTS band of 5.5 or equivalent is required for a two-term pre-masters, while for a three-term pre-masters, a minimum IELTS band of 5.0 or similar.</p><p>Notable universities with courses that offer pre-masters</p><h4>1. Kaplan Business School</h4><p><strong>Course: Postgraduate Qualifying Program</strong></p><p>The Postgraduate Qualifying Program from Kaplan Business School is for students who don’t quite meet the entry requirements for a master’s degree.

All METC Institute GAMSAT courses help students achieve a high score on the GAMSAT.</p><h3>Why is pre-masters beneficial?</h3><p>Obtaining a master’s degree in the United Kingdom necessitates a significant amount of time and devotion.<br>Even if you have strong grades on your undergraduate transcript, this does not guarantee that you will be able to succeed in today’s extremely competitive and demanding workplace.<br>It’s also critical to fill in the gaps in your learning if you’re returning to school after a vacation.<br>One of the most significant benefits of a pre-program master’s is that it prepares you for subject knowledge.<br>You’ll feel more confident and motivated to achieve your full-time degree if you know you have all the resources you need.<br>Developing a solid conceptual foundation will help you absorb complex topics more quickly, making your academic path a breeze.<br>Furthermore, you would have had plenty of practice writing academic essays, theses, and research papers during your pre-master.<br>You will be able to concentrate entirely on your research rather than worrying about the time and work required to write a research report.<br>The technical abilities you learn during a pre-master program will benefit you as a master’s student.<br>The time you spend on such a course will help you better comprehend the UK’s environment, culture, and way of life.<br>It is natural to experience culture shock or homesickness when you are studying abroad alone.<br>A pre-course master’s will allow you to adjust and adapt before beginning your degree.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>While the pre-program master’s is not for everyone, it helped me gain confidence and improve my English academic skills. So, if you need to enhance your English or obtain a basic understanding of your subject before enrolling in a long-term program, I would strongly advise you to enroll in a pre-program.

Living and studying in Australia is a fantastic experience</strong></p><p>When I told my mother about my ambition to study in Australia, one of the first things she learned was that Australia has some of the safest cities in the world. And I viewed it as a positive sign.<br><br><strong>2. Chance to study at prestigious universities around the world</strong></p><p>Did you know that Australia is the world’s third most popular destination for overseas students? Six of the world’s top 100 colleges are located in the country, making it one of the world’s leading educational powerhouses. That’s how it ended up on my ‘countries to consider’ list while I was thinking about my post-graduation plans.</p><p>Australian universities also have a wide range of majors and electives you choose from, resulting in a degree that is a complete reflection of your own tastes.<br><br><strong>3. Getting some work experience</strong></p><p>This was not a possibility in any of the nations where I had previously resided. International students are authorized to work in Australia for 20 hours per week during semester breaks and full-time during the rest of the year, making it the ideal way to offset my living expenditures, such as rent, utilities, groceries, and other necessities that are otherwise difficult to bear.</p><p><strong>4. Possibilities for employment after graduation</strong></p><p>Aside from the option that permits overseas students to work while studying, Australia also offers a Temporary Graduate Visa (subclass 485) that allows students to follow their career for up to four years after graduation if they study in regional Australia.</p><p>The country has job openings in a variety of fields, including digital marketing, civil design, human resources, and aeronautics, to mention a few.</p><p><strong>5. Improve your English language abilities</strong></p><p>Yes, this was something worth thinking about.

If you do not submit your application on time, you risk being deported, which could have an impact on future visa applications. Once you’ve decided that extending your student visa is the best option, you’ll need to get the following things in order:</p><p><strong>Enrollment Confirmation (CoE)</strong></p><p>The formal document from the educational institution is the Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE). The Certificate of Enrolment (CoE) contains information regarding the applicant’s enrollment status. The course duration, fees paid, and total fees owed are all included in this information. When applying for a student visa, this document is required. While studying in Australia, your CoE must be valid at all times, and cancellation may have an impact on your visa status.</p><p><strong>Language Requirements in English</strong></p><p>You’ll need proof of your English language abilities in the form of documents. This can be demonstrated by taking an IELTS or comparable test. You must submit your English language test results with your application.</p><p><strong>Student Health Insurance for Overseas Students</strong></p><p>All international students must have and maintain health insurance for the duration of their stay in Australia, according to the Australian government. You must keep your current Overseas Student Health Coverage (OSHC). OSHC does not renew itself and must be renewed to span the period of your new visa. The start and finish dates must correspond to the student visa. As a result, you must contact your healthcare provider and renew your coverage.</p><p><strong>Examine your health</strong></p><p>When applying for a student visa, you must undergo a medical examination. This shows that you are in excellent health to the Department of Home Affairs. You must submit documents with your application to show proof of the health checks. Your ImmiAccount will issue you a HAP number as well as a referral letter for a clinic that details all of the essential assessments.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Financial Prerequisites</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The application must show that you have the financial means to meet your expenses, including course fees, travel, and living expenses. This is accomplished by submitting employment documents as well as proof of your annual income and assets. There will also be a request for proof of true access to the requisite funds.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Documents needed for visa extension</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to personal documentation, you’ll need to submit the following information to prove your identity:</p><ul><li>Certificate of Birth</li><li>Identity page of a passport (i.e. every page with visa sample &amp; immigration stamp)</li><li>Card of National Identification</li><li>Every page of the household registration book, as well as</li><li>A curriculum vitae (certified by the local authorities)</li><li>Certificate of Marriage (for married students)</li><li>Number of the OSHC Policy</li><li>HAP Identification Number</li><li>Proof of financial capability</li><li>Codes for Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE)</li></ul><p><strong>Process of student visa extension</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1: Register for the course</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Obtaining a fresh Confirmation of Enrolment (CoE) from your educational institution is the first step in the application process. It’s critical to allow time for the educational department to process this and return it to you. Processing timeframes vary, but they normally range from 5 to 10 days. This process can also be influenced by how quickly you pay your fees, as they will not be processed unless you do so. You will receive an email confirming your enrolment after all of the prerequisites have been satisfied and the fees have been paid (CoE).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 2: Set up Overseas Student Health Insurance (OSHC</strong></p><p>The next step in the procedure is to get your health insurance in order. Once you’ve confirmed that your health insurance is valid for the duration of your stay with the insurance provider, you can begin compiling all of the essential visa documents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 3: Get your visa documents ready</strong></p><p>It’s vital to keep in mind that the list of required visa documents varies depending on your place of origin and the education provider you choose. As a result, each applicant’s checklist is unique. The document checklist tool on the Department of Home Affairs website, however, can help. It’s crucial to remember that the checklist is subject to change, so it’s a good idea to check the website for updates frequently.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 4: Meet the criteria for a Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE)</strong></p><p>All student visas must meet the Genuine Temporary Entrant (GTE) criterion. The GTE lets the Department of Home Affairs determine whether or not the applicant is serious about studying in Australia. You must include a personal statement as part of this procedure to demonstrate that you are sincerely interested. The personal statement should include information about your life and how the course will benefit you in the future. This gives the candidate a chance to talk about their situation in their native country and their potential future if their student visa is approved. You should provide as many documents as possible to back up all of your points.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Apply for a student visa</strong></p><p>Submitting a student visa application with your Immi Account is the final step in the application process. To proceed, you must attach all essential documents and pay a charge. You can also hire a migration consultant to assist you with your online application. If you submitted your student visa application while onshore, the Department of Home Affairs will mail you a letter of acceptance along with a Bridging Visa (BVA). Check your nominated email address for any correspondence regarding the status of your application frequently. This can aid in a smooth and quick application process.</p><p><strong>Financial proof/fund for visa extension</strong></p><p>Depending on your visa category and country assessment, you may be required to produce proof of financial capabilities to continue studying in Australia. There are a variety of options available, including:</p><p><strong>Fund For Yearly Months</strong></p><p>This choice is appropriate if you intend to study for a further year or more. Evidence of money sufficient to pay your stay, tuition fees, and living expenses in Australia for the duration of your stay, which is usually 12 months. It also includes a travel itinerary that includes a trip return to Australia (about $1000- $1200), living expenses in Australia (approximately AUD$20,000–AUD 21,000), and a one-year tuition price for whichever subject and length of study you select.</p><p><strong>Annual Income Evidence</strong></p><p>If you want to participate in a short or long course, evidence of annual income from your sponsor, parent, spouse, or personal income is necessary for an Australian Student visa. It is estimated that it will cost around AUD 60,000.</p><p><strong>Waiver on student visa application by dept of home affairs</strong></p><p>If you had a student visa on or after 1 February 2020 and couldn’t finish your course within the original visa validity due to COVID-19’s effects, we will waive the visa application fee to allow you to file a new student visa application. This applies to you if you:</p><ul><li>you had to postpone your studies since you were unable to visit Australia due to travel restrictions.</li><li>were obliged to lower their academic burden to part-time</li><li>you weren’t able to finish your work-based training or placements</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>If your visa is denied, more information may be needed. In this case, they will send you an email asking for more information. If your visa is merely denied, you will have the option of hiring a migration lawyer to challenge the decision. It’s vital to emphasize that this only applies to applicants for onshore visas.</p>', 'the-step-by-step-guide-to-understand-australian-student-visa-extension-as-an-international-studenti', 'admin/image/blog/thumbnail/blog_1659007090_377759.png', 1, '2022-07-28 21:18:10', '2022-07-28 21:18:10'),

Also, the universities ask for your IELTS results to ensure about a student’s prowess in English. Additionally, they want to be certain about the academic qualifications a student holds like they can ask for a student’s O levels and A Levels certificates. Besides these, they want to ensure which course I prefer for my upcoming sessions.

If he or she is already employed he or she has to fill up that question, however if he or she is unemployed then this is not a required question for the students. After the academic organization has received a student’s application, he or she will be apprised about the results.

International students can buy their stationeries from Officeworks and Kmart at low costs.&nbsp; The accommodations are provided on and off campus to the students by their respective universities. Those who provide accommodations to the students include the electricity bill, gas bill, water bill and internet bill in the rent.

But it would help if you remembered that changing courses here in Australia is not a simple process as an international student.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are six reasons why international students change courses:</p><ul><li><i><strong>After studying for a while, you realized the course wasn’t as expected. </strong></i>You don’t find it as interesting as you did.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Found the course too hard. </strong></i>You are having a hard time understanding and getting it.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>It wasn’t financially feasible to study this course.</strong></i> The course expenses exceeded your budget and capability, and bearing the cost is becoming burdensome.</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>I couldn’t generate the expected results.</strong></i> Fall behind on credits and can’t maintain good academic results.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>Failed to see desired career prospects.</strong></i> The career choices don’t match your dream jobs or what you expect. Other courses have better-desired career prospects.</li></ul><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i><strong>In case you prefer to study another course. </strong></i>You found your passion and interest in some other course and would like to devote your efforts to learning that.</li></ul><p><br><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>For locals, the process is reasonably straightforward, but there’s a bit of work for international students. And there are a few things you must take into account.</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You must have six-plus months of your courses completed because you’ll require the permission of your current education provider to transfer, and you won’t get it if you haven’t completed more than six months of the course unless you have strong reasons.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>&nbsp;If your end date of confirmation of enrollment changes with the change of your course, you’ll have to apply for a new visa within 28 days of completing your main course to avoid canceling your visa or leaving Australia.</li></ul><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>You’ll need to ensure that you’ve maintained good academic results, for many courses will only accept you if your GPA is at a certain level.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Step by step guided way to a successful course change is explained below briefly:</p><ul><li><i><strong>Book an appointment with a student adviser</strong></i>. A student adviser will be able to guide you properly and reduce the chances of missed opportunities, financial distress, or student visa issues. That way, you’ll be able to go through all your options and choices, whether you’ll need to change institutions or just go for internal transfer and everything.</li><li><i><strong>Consider Visa requirements </strong></i>so that you don’t end up with a canceled visa or made to leave Australia.</li><li><i><strong>Understand your financial obligations</strong></i>. Check with your education counselor to go through your financial aid and scholarship options. Studying is costly and changing courses will add upon extra charges on you.</li><li><i><strong>Select a new course or institution.</strong></i> Do your research. See which institution or courses suit you and your interests to pursue the degree.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Once you receive an offer, you can seek credit for a study you’ve already completed depending on the situation. It’s not a loss even if you change courses after 3 or 4 years. We don’t always know what we want or where our potential lies when we choose our courses in the first year. Through exploration is how we find the stage where we shine the brightest. So don’t hold back from following your passion and go for it.

The accreditation system in Canada is a bit different. According to the council for higher education (CHEA), accreditation reviews the quality of higher education institutions and programs. This can entail an institution or just a specific academic program. Accreditation agencies were originally formed to ensure the transferability of credits between institutions. However, it has many subparts as it directly affects various aspects of an institution and a student’s academic journey. Now, what exactly are Accredited and Non-Accredited Universities?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Accredited</strong></i> means that the university or education institution has been certified that the institution meets specific standards and can fulfill its mission. It’s a way of telling that the institution is legit and worth your money, time, and effort. <i><strong>Non-Accredited</strong></i> means that the university hasn’t been checked by experts for its authenticity and may or may not be worth your money, time, and effort. In Canada, each province and territory is responsible for every educational institution inside it, and they oversee the accreditation process. In Manitoba, the Department of Advanced Education handles the process. There’s no federal accreditation in Canada. However, some universities seek evaluation from American regional accreditation agencies. To confirm if an educational institution is recognized and accredited, you’ll have to contact your provincial or territorial student financial aid authority.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>The core difference between the two:</strong></i></p><p>Accredited &nbsp; – &nbsp; When you are in an accredited university, there’s no questioning its standard of education, methods, skills they equip you with, its validity in the market, and authenticity. You will be eligible for federal government aid and loans. There is no risk of getting rejected by the government or other big corporations.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Non-Accredited – In Non-Accredited universities, there are no federal government loans or aid, so you’ll have to pay from your pocket or depend on private aiding organizations.</p><p>&nbsp;Unless your institution is accredited, some organizations don’t allow you to apply for a permit. The institution might be a scam, and their education and programs might not be legit. If you ever transfer to another school, credit transfer to accredited universities would not be possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Benefits of Accredited Universities:</strong></i></p><ul><li><strong>Financial Eligibility: </strong>according to CHEA, to seek to offer federal financial aid, the school must be accredited. Only schools that meet those standards and have been certified as authentic can get the benefits with no exception.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Academic Rigor:&nbsp;</strong> The academic requirements and course contents are reviewed and ensured to be met by an external curriculum.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Up-to-Date Knowledge and skills: </strong>with accreditation, the quality of education, its relevancy, and currency are guaranteed. It means academic programming- the tools and resources used- is updated with industry standards and best practices.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The faculty reputation </strong>helps to determine an institution’s positive reputation, including the expertise of its faculty members demonstrating expertise in their field and among peers.</li></ul><p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>&nbsp;Employment Opportunities: </strong>Many employers require graduates to be from accredited schools or programs. Some industries require specific certifications or licensure, and accreditation can make a difference in taking these exams or completing additional application requirements. Plus, having an accredited school listed on a resume could distinguish among candidates.</li></ul><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Student Service Support:</strong>&nbsp;<strong> </strong>If a school is accredited, it is evident that students’ support meets standard requirements. Having access to a library and other resources is often required to be accredited.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Going to an accredited school isn’t a must to thrive in the future. Great renowned schools aren’t accredited but are a plus point for you.

Students are keen to pursue higher education in the United Kingdom since costs are lower than in Australia and the United States, and courses begin as early as three years. Going to university in the United Kingdom is a fantastic way to broaden one’s horizons. A degree from the United Kingdom is more valued because it serves as a passport to professional success. At university, the student will have plenty of assistance and the opportunity to live the student lifestyle. As a result, studying in the United Kingdom from Bangladesh is a popular option. Thousands of Bangladeshi students opt to study in London each year because of its high educational standards, affordable courses, and excellent job prospects. Around half of the Bangladeshi students stay in London.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why should a Bangladeshi student study in London?</strong></p><p>Bangladeshi students in London have several alternatives to studying abroad, and they can travel to many different countries for higher education. A valid question is why one should study in the United Kingdom. Let’s look at some aspects that make the United Kingdom one of the top countries for Bangladeshi students to study.</p><p><strong>The global education leader: </strong>According to the QS World University Rankings, the United Kingdom boasts four of the world’s top six institutions, which indicates that the UK has a high educational quality, which will make it easier for you to obtain your ideal career. It also enables Bangladeshi students in London to gain admission to their desired university following the graduation competition in the United Kingdom.</p><p><strong>International standing: </strong>An international student always chooses a country whose education is recognized internationally and in their own country, providing more chances. This is one of the reasons why UK universities are so well-known worldwide. Employers, institutions, and even government offices worldwide hold British education in high esteem.</p><p><strong>Money’s worth: </strong>Universities in the United Kingdom provide good value for money in affordable undergraduate and postgraduate courses, often shorter than those offered elsewhere. Which lowers the number of money students must pay as a tuition charge while simultaneously reducing their living expenditures. So, if you’re from Bangladesh and want to study abroad but can’t afford it, the United Kingdom is the answer.</p><p>That’s not all; overseas students profit more from studying in the UK. They can enhance their English (the UK being an English-speaking country) and learn about different cultures because students from all over the world can be found easily.</p><p><strong>High-ranked universities in the UK for Bangladeshi students</strong></p><p><strong>University of West London</strong></p><p>The University of West London is an excellent place further to continue the education of any Bangladeshi student in London. There are numerous self-study courses available. The University of West London understands how to help students advance in their careers. Students will remember the time spent at this exciting university from the first day to the last.</p><ul><li>Courses for undergraduates start at £10,700 per year.</li><li>Courses for postgraduate students start at £10,000 per year.</li></ul><p><strong>The University of Cumbria</strong></p><p>The University of Cumbria is a low-cost public university in the United Kingdom. This university has been providing high-quality education to its students since 2007. This university has around 7600 students and provides nearly 100 different academic courses. The course instructors are well-educated and supportive of the Bangladeshi students in London.</p><ul><li>Courses for undergraduates start at £9000 per year.</li><li>Courses for postgraduate students start at £9500 per year.</li></ul><p><strong>University of Suffolk</strong></p><p>The University of Suffolk is in Ipswich, which is a beautiful city. Students are more engaged because of the housing structure and the student-friendly weather. Approximately 7700 students are now enrolled, with 10% being Bangladeshi students in London.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Courses for undergraduates start at £10,100 per year.</li><li>Courses for postgraduate students start at £10,080 per year.</li></ul><p><strong>Coventry University</strong></p><p>Coventry University is a low-cost public university in Coventry, England, and one of the most popular destinations for international students seeking excellent educational opportunities. Almost 35,000 students are enrolled in undergraduate and postgraduate degree programs.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Courses for undergraduates start at £9000 per year.</li><li>Courses for postgraduate students start at £9500 per year.</li></ul><p><strong>Necessary steps to study for Bangladeshi students in London</strong></p><p>Making it possible for Bangladeshi students to study in the United Kingdom entails several processes. Many students are perfectly prepared to study in the United Kingdom do not comprehend these stages and do not submit the appropriate paperwork to the various universities on time. As a result, students not only lose hope of studying in the United Kingdom but also money and time. We can make the entire procedure very simple and quick as qualified agents.</p><p>The measures that is taken to certify a student’s arrival from Bangladesh to the United Kingdom are as follows:</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Choose a course based on your past educational history and your goals for studying in the UK.</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Find a university that offers this course at a reasonable cost in the upcoming semesters.</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>We will meet all the university’s admission standards on your behalf to secure your acceptance.</p><p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Deliver the admission letter from the University of the United Kingdom to verify the admission and begin the Visa application procedure.</p><p>After your admission has been confirmed, you can apply for a student visa in the United Kingdom. We will assist you throughout the process to make things as simple as possible.</p><p><strong>Documents required for an application for Bangladeshi students in London</strong></p><p>When it comes to admission, each university in the United Kingdom has its documentation requirements. There is a nearly identical set of documents that Bangladeshi students must present for undergraduate and postgraduate admission in the United Kingdom. The following documents were typically required.</p><ul><li>Copy of passport scanned</li><li>Scanned copies of educational certificates</li><li>Scanned copies of educational mark sheets</li><li>Mission statement (letter of motivation)</li><li>Copy of IELTS certificate scanned (if required)</li><li>Letter of employment experience (if needed)</li><li>Other documentation may be required.</li></ul><p>Some colleges may require fewer documents than others. Some universities, for example, exclude IELTS requirements based on past education.</p><p><strong>How will you live there?</strong></p><p>Most universities in the United Kingdom provide overseas students with on-campus housing called Halls of Residence. Self-catering or full-board options are available. Some campuses also offer students with self-catered shared apartments or flats. Living on campus as a resident is a very cost-effective choice. However, you must apply for it separately and well ahead of time to obtain a spot.</p><p>Suppose you can’t find such a place. In that case, you may have to look for a room to rent.

Malaysia is an excellent fit for studying abroad, and the process was friendly until COVID.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;The COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia is part of the ongoing worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease. Since January 2020, proper medical responses and preparedness have prevented the worst-case scenario. Following that, during severe COVID waves, the Malaysian government imposed the movement control order(MCO)&nbsp; that included the prohibition of mass gatherings. People returning from abroad must undergo health checkups and self-quarantine for 14 days, restrict tourism and foreign visitors, and close schools, kindergartens, governments, and other institutions except for essential services. Malaysia is currently ranked third in the number of COVID-19 cases in South Asia, behind Vietnam and Indonesia, with the BA.2 omicron sub-variant projected as the dominant strain in the country right now. As of April 20, 2022, there have been 44,02,234 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with 35,449 deaths reported to WHO. And as of March 31, 2022, a total of 6,89,46,956 vaccine doses have been administered. On September 7, 2020, the immigration department banned nationals from 23 countries with many COVID-19 cases, including Bangladesh. On October 10, 2021, the prime minister lifted travel restrictions for citizens and residents who have been vaccinated against COVID-19&nbsp;and allowed&nbsp;free travel for them. On April 1, 2022, Malaysia opened its borders for fully vaccinated international visitors.

The documentation process of renewing your visa or getting a visa permit has gotten harder than before. And it’s even worse in Malaysia as&nbsp;students need to get back to their own country to renew their student visas, which wasn’t possible due to the travel restrictions during the serious waves of COVID-19. Even if you somehow managed to go to your country and return to Malaysia, it would have cost you triple the amount for expenses, quarantine, accommodation, etc. And for the students newly enrolled, it was a fundamental uncertainty. While they could pay the tuition insurance and other pre-costs, online payment and registering for courses would be hard to finance.</p><p>The biggest impact COVID-19 left on the lives of international students was that they had more expenses, no reassurance of the future, and no income. Their studies were hampered, and there were no right choices. Similarly, it is challenging for Bangladeshi students that they could return to Malaysia and finish their respective courses. Now things are slowly going back to normal, and fully vaccinated people can travel to and fro Malaysia and other countries, including Bangladesh, without quarantine and movement restrictions.

On the other hand, a 2 years postgraduate diploma degree includes four to six semesters in total. The advantage of doing two years of post graduation in Canada is that it allows you to work for three years. Canada is the famous end of the line for the postgraduate courses particularly in these areas like tourism, hotel management and supply chain management. After the student has completed his or her post graduation in Canada, they would like to receive a permanent residency in Canada.

To reduce the rapidly growing virus Covid 19, the government-imposed lockdowns, requiring people to wear masks, use hand sanitizer and maintain social distance. The virus mutated and formed a new variant. The British government has proclaimed that anyone traveling to the UK should get tested Covid negative. Within the two days of boarding a flight, the covid test must be done. To take two doses of the vaccine before traveling became a mandatory prerequisite. The figures do not show the number of Bangladeshi students studying in the UK; instead, they show that approximately 190 Bangladeshi students are studying in the UK.</p><p>Many Universities welcomed international students during the covid situation. However, an international student would go abroad to study depending on the restrictions imposed by the country’s government to which they choose to go and their own country. Every university has its separate procedures, yet most universities abroad are actively welcoming international students. During the pandemic situation in 2020, the universities conducted their classes online and provided lectures online. Some universities have decided to run the courses online, including Cambridge University in London during the year 2020-2021. However, small groups in the universities have taken physical classes.</p><p>On the other hand, the schools were closed during the outbreak period. So, as the schools remained closed, the students couldn’t give the final exams and collect their certificates. It reduced the chances for the students of getting admitted to a university.

If an individual is impotent to show the proof of Covid vaccination, they must show the evidence of the negative result of the Covid 19 RT PCR test before two days of flight to Bangladesh. An individual should take a personal test; they should not take the service from the NHS to move to another country. A traveler who has Covid manifestations should take a PCR test before traveling. Those passengers who have tested Covid positive should be quarantined for at least seven days under the government’s sanction provision. The passengers should remain quarantined until tested negative by doing the PCR test. The government would bear the expenses while the passengers stay in their authorized hotels. Also, if the passengers are required to take the Covid tests, the government would pay the costs. Suppose the travelers tested Covid positive while they were staying in quarantine.

He must understand what is going on in the students’ minds, whether they have got the content or not. As a result, his grades assist him in discovering this information. Although a grade cannot determine someone’s abilities, it can motivate them to grow. True, the grading system began in the production lines to determine if the thing being manufactured was of excellent quality or not. Throughout your time as a student, you will require maintaining track of your grades regularly. However, the grading systems can differ dramatically depending on where you go. A few countries use many systems, while others use a rating system. They use a letter grading system inside the United States of America.</p><p>Every time you finish an assignment, your instructor will put a letter at the top. That letter will inform you of how well (or poorly) you performed on the work. You range from excellent to not so great from A to F(called Criterion-referenced grading system, which is based on a fixed numeric scale, usually equated to a letter mark, from which the faculty assign grades based on the individual performance of each student.). They do, however, have a percentage behind them. And the percentage usually indicates how many questions on an exam you got right or how many prerequisites you met throughout the course. Consider the following example:</p><ul><li>“A” – is the highest possible grade you can get on an assignment, ranging from 90% to 100%.</li><li>“B” – Is still a good grade! This is a higher-than-average score, ranging from 80 to 89 percent.</li><li>“C” – This is a grade that sits in the middle of the scale. C is a percentage that ranges from 70 to 79 percent.</li><li>“D “- This is still a passing grade, with 59 to 69 percent.</li><li>A failing grade is an F.</li></ul><p><strong>The US university grading system:</strong> In most universities in the United States, your grades do not stand alone. They frequently coincide to what is known as a quality point.</p><p>The quality point is a quantity your grade has, which may be used to analyze your GPA (which we’ll talk about in the next section). Your letter grades will be calculated on a different scale (most use a 4.0 scale) at each school, college, and other higher education institution, but an A will always equal 4 or a multiple of 4.</p><p><strong>A Grade Point Average (GPA):</strong>&nbsp; Is calculated based on your overall grades (GPA)</p><p>A grade point average (GPA) is a critical figure for students. Your GPA is utilized for everything: scholarships, club membership, graduation, and applying to other schools.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In principle, your GPA should reflect the type of student you are. Have you gotten A’s in the majority of your classes? Then your GPA is most likely around 4.0. Are you an average student who had some great and challenging courses? Your GPA is most likely 2.5 or 3. Did you begin with a difficult task and then work your way up? That’s reflected in your GPA as well!</p><p>Your average GPA at an American university is calculated by accumulating the quality points from each grade (see the preceding section), then dividing by the number of course credits you attempted. Your GPA is the result of this calculation.</p><p><strong>Why there is no “E” grade:</strong> In 1897, the letter E had the same meaning as F, i.e., it was the lowest possible grade. The other four grades are regarded as “passing,” so they are listed alphabetically. On the other hand, parents and kids found it easier to comprehend that “F” meant “Failed.” Rather than a lack of knowledge of the alphabet from academic institutions, the apparent reason is that “F” stands for “fail.”</p>', 'the-united-states-grading-systemi', 'admin/image/blog/thumbnail/blog_1659012454_406413.png', 1, '2022-07-28 22:47:34', '2022-07-28 22:47:34'),

There are currently over one million of them. Let’s have a look at a few of the reasons for this.</p><p><strong>Universities with the highest rankings in the world</strong></p><p>The United States has a well-developed and high-quality tertiary education system. According to the 2017-2018 Times Higher Education World University Rankings, it has seven of the top ten universities in the world. In fact, the United States is home to 33 of the top 100 universities in the world [source: QS World Ranking 2019].</p><p><strong>Unique curriculum and high-quality education</strong></p><p>The United States’ educational system is well-known around the world. Students who attend US institutions benefit from a liberal arts education, which is one of the reasons they are so successful after graduation. This entails a concentration on areas beyond one’s major, such as mathematics, sciences, philosophy, history, and literature.</p><p><strong>Language abilities in English</strong></p><p>In the United States, English is the primary language spoken, and all courses are taught in English. You’ll be able to improve your talents and make yourself more appealing to companies. Most US campuses have English language programs tailored to international students, as well as study groups and mentoring programs where you may put your language skills to the test.</p><p><strong>Research and development</strong></p><p>The United States is a leader in scientific and creative innovation. Large research institutes, particularly in the United States, provide opportunities for students to work side by side with their instructors in the lab or workshop, applying what they’ve learned in class. Universities in the United States enthusiastically promote their faculty members’ fieldwork, and information on research possibilities for students is widely available.</p><p><strong>How Covid-19 had affected the abroad studying facilities in the US?</strong></p><p>Whatever your circumstances, one thing to remember is that studying abroad is still a viable option. The majority of universities, particularly in Europe, allow international students. In addition, visa application centers are beginning to reopen, and the vast majority of institutions have devised contingency plans in the event of further lockdowns, limitations, or travel bans.</p><p>It’s also important recalling that in a post-COVID world, the global view of the future is usually favorable. Governments have begun to respond to unexpected issues, and several safety precautions have been developed, such as mass testing and “track and trace” systems.</p><p>In terms of healthcare, the majority of European students will be covered in the event of an emergency. This isn’t always the case, though. Always check the laws of the country you’re visiting. Health insurance will almost certainly be required for anyone traveling into or out of the European Union. It’s also a good idea to find out if you’ll require a COVID-19 PCR test before you fly or when you get to your campus country.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Covid situation in both BD and the US</strong></p><p><strong>The UK</strong></p><ul><li>Regardless of immunization status or country, all inbound international travelers must test within one day of departure.</li><li>Beginning November 8, the White House stated that COVID-19 travel restrictions for fully vaccinated international visitors will be lifted, erasing historic restrictions that had prohibited much of the world from visiting the US for up to 21 months.</li><li>Covid-19 forced significant changes in US rules controlling international student status and visas last year.&nbsp;</li><li>The US government had chosen to continue recognizing electronic or digital travel signatures on immigration forms issued by schools in order to comply with ongoing pandemic-related limitations.&nbsp;</li><li>DSOs can either sign the paperwork physically or electronically, according to the rules.

Also, give scholarships to students who conquered academic excellence successfully. The proportion of benefits offered by the universities of Toronto outweighs the disadvantages. Additionally, they allow multicultural people to move to the country which helps the international students to find their culture in a different region.

It is Malaysia’s sole global metropolis, with 1.73 million people and a landmass of 243 km2 (94 sq. mi). In terms of population and economic development, it is one of Southeast Asia’s fastest, exponentially growing urban areas.

This confluence of characteristics has turned the city into a cosmopolitan hotspot for international students seeking a high-quality education while also living a vibrant lifestyle.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Tuition and expenses:</strong>&nbsp; Malaysia, and by extension KL (Kuala Lumpur), offers a varied selection of study options to suit various budgets. Studying at a local private institution is far less expensive, with a three-year business degree costing between USD 8,600 and 11,400 and a three-year medical degree costing between USD 62,900 and 108,600. Tuition fees are reasonable and low compared to the UK, Australia, and Canada. Tuition fees and living costs are almost like Bangladesh. So, it is easy for a student to run their studies.</p><p><strong>Cost of living in Malaysia for international students:</strong> Because of its inexpensive cost of living and high quality of life, Malaysia attracts many international students. Malaysia is a much more economical place to study for overseas students compared to other countries. QS ranked Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia’s capital, as the second most affordable student city. These costs can be subsidized through many scholarships available in Malaysia, both from the government and from specific colleges. The Malaysian Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan (CSFP) are available to international students.</p><p><strong>Why should a Bangladeshi student study in Malaysia?</strong></p><p>Malaysia is a secure and pleasant environment in which to study. Its sophisticated infrastructure and efficient transportation system make it a geographically safe country free of natural calamities. It offers warm, temperate weather year-round. Lower living costs and tuition expenses, as well as a diverse learning environment. These qualities entice Bangladeshi students to study in Malaysia.</p><p><strong>Malaysian Design Of the study:</strong></p><p>Malaysia’s education system follows European standards that are recognized worldwide with renowned private and governmental universities. All of the universities are spacious and well-equipped with air conditioning. These include free wifi services, a well-equipped library, and top-notch laboratory facilities. The Malaysian educational system is based on assignments, and students are required to provide multimedia presentations.</p><p><strong>Subjects currently offered:</strong> Malaysian universities provide nearly all issues based on recommendation.

An international student can work in a restaurant, a hotel, a grocery store, and various other places. Students are free to work on campus at any time.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last but perhaps not least, studying in Malaysia is one of the most significant possibilities for Bangladeshi students because Malaysia is a civilized economy with a top-ranked educational institute and a diverse range of disciplines. Many Malaysian universities and colleges provide a kitchenette for students living on campus to make light meals. If you don’t want to cook, KL boasts a plethora of vendors, restaurants, and food courts where you can get your daily meals for a meager price. A monthly grocery budget of around USD 100 would be highly comfortable. Malaysia also permits students to work while studying to supplement their income.</p><p><strong>Close to Home</strong></p><p>Unlike Canada, Australia, the USA or any other countries that Bangladeshi students usually go for higher studies, Malaysia is pretty close by. A flight from Kuala Lumpur to Dhaka is about four hours. This keeps the students and their parents at ease, assuring them that they are just four hours away from home and in case of any emergencies it would not be hard for them to come back. Besides, the cost of flight is comparatively lower, which sums up to roughly RM1500 (BDT 29000). This lower cost allows the students to visit their homes often, more importantly they do not have to miss out on any religious celebrations, family occasions or as such. This reason alone can be enough to let someone consider Malaysia for higher studies.</p><p><strong>High Quality, Yet Affordable Education</strong></p><p>Malaysia provides with opportunities to study from 600 plus universities around the country and all of them are in SETARA rankings. The reputation of Malaysian educational sector is rising day by day which clearly shows in the global ranking of universities. The World Economic Forum has ranked Malaysia as one of the leading countries in education. It is currently the only Asian country to make it to the top ten list of the world’s leading academic and research institution, by securing an excellent rank in the Global Ranking of Academic Reputation (GRAR). Not to mention, the tuition fee of Malaysian universities is pretty affordable too, in comparison to other counties. Students do not need to show their bank balance, hence no sponsors are required. On top of that, they are allowed to work maximum 20 hours per week. Furthermore, the conditions for admitting into Malaysian universities are not so strict. IELTS is not mandatory for all of the universities here. Also, age or study gaps are not that big of an issue. In case of credit transfer, universities in Malaysia offer that opportunity too!</p><p><strong>Living Cost is Affordable Too</strong></p><p>The living cost in Malaysia is almost the same compared to Bangladesh. According to the QS Best Student Cities rankings, Kuala Lumpur ranks number two in the world for affordability. Education Malaysia Global Service (EMGS) conducted a study once that showed an international student in Malaysia would need approximately RM1.8k (BDT 37.1k) every month including all living expenses. Of course, the amount can be more or less, depending on how much or how little you are willing to spend. Very few countries are generous enough to offer a decent lifestyle at such affordable cost. Students keep western counties on the top of their list for quality education. But, we all know how expensive living there can be. In this case, Malaysia can be a really good option.</p><p><strong>All-in-all a Good Living Environment</strong></p><p>Malaysia is a really good country to live in, especially for students. With 9% of the population being foreigners, Malaysia is kind of like a melting pot of migrants all over the world. The local people seem to be getting along with international students pretty well. As people from other countries are not seen as strangers, all the residents are treated fairly and with respect. It is no doubt that, the natural beauty of Malaysia has turned it into a lush tropical paradise. Thus, students often like to explore the country at their free time. The safe environment with political stability has made this easy for students to visit all the popular hotspots around the country. Moreover, the all-year-round weather of Malaysia is another pleasant thing! May it be summer or winter, students are prone to find the climate favorable all twelve months of the year. Not to mention, the lifestyle of Malaysia is pretty much halal in all way possible. Since, most of the students moved from Bangladesh are Muslims; it is extremely conveniently for them. Even though religious wise the country is secular, the larger number of citizens is Muslim. Hence, it has sprawling number of Mosques throughout major cities and towns. You can even easily hear ‘Adhan’ (call to prayer) from your apartment or hostel room. Besides, the wide variety of halal foods and trendy Muslim fashion are everything a Muslim student can ask for in a foreign country.</p><p><strong>Diverse Range of Options to Choose Your Field of Study</strong></p><p>Even though Bangladeshi public universities have quite a number of subjects to study, most of the private universities rely on some specific subjects that they feel will bring them profits. Then again, the number of seat in public universities is limited and every year students have to fight tooth and nail for their preferred subjects. Many students succumb to this competitiveness and fall out, shattering their dreams to study in a subject they like. Malaysia, on the other hand is providing a wide range of diversified subjects like, Hotel management, Tourism, Marine Biotechnology, Interior Architecture etc. You can even find out subjects that you have never heard about here. So, if you want to study econometrics or 3D Animation design Malaysia is the country to go!</p><p>In this era of globalization, all students want to keep a foreign degree up on their sleeve. Studying abroad has so many benefits that go beyond the primary goal of acquiring better academic qualifications. Studying in a different culture helps to gain a different perspective, engaging students with various life experiences. Considering all things, Malaysia offers everything an international student can ever ask for. Hence, every year more and more Bangladeshi students are drawn towards Malaysia as of their next big step in academic life.</p>', 'bangladeshi-students-in-kuala-lumpur-malaysia', 'admin/image/blog/thumbnail/blog_1659016492_452392.png', 1, '2022-07-28 23:54:52', '2022-07-29 00:00:45');
